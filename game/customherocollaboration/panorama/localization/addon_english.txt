He has no skills that do anything in and of themselves; they all interact with his inventory in some way. *Reverse Engineering* assimilates the active ability of one of the Cyborg’s items into one of two ability slots, making any two items' abilities essentially two of the Cyborg’s skills instead. *Efficiency* doubles the bonuses of weaker, cheaper items, giving the Cyborg extreme gold efficiency, hence the name. *Prototype* turns any Recipes in the Cyborg’s inventory into their full items for a limited time, potentially giving him a massive but short power spike. Finally, the Cyborg’s ultimate *Multicore* grants him bonus inventory slots, allowing him to accumulate even more precious items. With 10 item slots from *Multicore*, 2 additional pseudo-item-slots from *Reverse Engineering*, and remarkable utilization of his items with *Efficiency* and *Prototype*, the Cyborg is a potent core in the midgame and one of the hardest carries in DotA in the very late game, provided he can acquire the necessary items"
